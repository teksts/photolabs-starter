# Photolabs
Photolabs is a mockup of a stock image site built in order to learn React, as part of my bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. The app presents a single-page application for viewing stock 
photos by topic, and viewing photos related to a given photo. An emphasis was placed on behaviour over styling, to achieve robust app functionality in a limited time frame.

Click a topic in the navigation bar to filter the photos viewed by topic.

Click on a photo to view an enlarged version, and to see a set of related photos.
